                    <h4>Dispute Resolution – Arbitration & Class Action Waiver</h4>
                    <p>PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THIS SECTION AS IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS THE PROCESS FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND Fasttrackr.

                        In the event of any dispute or claim arising from your use of the Services, you agree to first attempt to resolve the matter directly with Fasttrackr by contacting us at support@fasttrackr.com. If the matter remains unresolved after 30 days, it will be considered a "Dispute" as defined below. Except for seeking injunctive relief, both parties agree to resolve any Disputes through binding arbitration on an individual basis.
                        
                        Binding Arbitration: Any Disputes arising from this Agreement or your use of the Services will be settled through binding arbitration, except for seeking injunctive relief in court to protect intellectual property rights. Both parties waive the right to a trial by jury. However, you may bring a claim in small claims court if eligible and if it remains in an individual, non-class, and non-representative capacity.
                        
                        Class Action Waiver: Disputes will be resolved on an individual basis, and class, consolidated, or representative actions are waived by both parties. The arbitrator may not consolidate claims or preside over any form of class action.
                        
                        Arbitration Administration and Rules: The American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will administer the arbitration following its rules, except as modified in this section.
                        
                        Arbitration Process: The party initiating arbitration must provide a written Demand for Arbitration to the other party as specified by AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be selected from the AAA's roster of arbitrators with relevant experience.
                        
                        Arbitration Location and Procedure: Unless otherwise agreed, arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California. Depending on the claim amount, the arbitration may be based solely on submitted documents or involve a hearing. The arbitrator may conduct hearings by telephone or video conference upon request.
                        
                        Arbitrator’s Decision and Governing Law: The arbitrator will apply California law and render an award within the timeframe specified by AAA Rules. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to the extent necessary to provide relief for the individual claim.
                        
                        Fees: Each party is responsible for arbitration fees as per AAA Rules.
                        
                        These arbitration provisions do not prevent either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in court to prevent infringement of intellectual property rights. This Agreement and your use of the Services are governed by the laws of the State of California, except as provided otherwise in this Agreement.</p>
                    <h4>Governing Law</h4>
                    <p>Unless otherwise specified, this Agreement and your use of the Services are governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles.</p>
                    <h4>No Agency; No Employment</h4>
                    <p>This Agreement does not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, or franchiser-franchisee relationship between you and Fasttrackr.</p>
                    <h4>General Provisions</h4>
                    <p>Fasttrackr's failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement does not waive its right to do so later. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Fasttrackr, superseding any prior agreements or communications. If any provision is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, it will be modified or excised without affecting the validity of the remaining provisions. This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by you without Fasttrackr's prior written approval.</p>
                    <h4>Changes to this Agreement and the Services</h4>
                    <p>Fasttrackr reserves the right to change, modify, or discontinue any terms of this Agreement or the Services at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of the Services after any such changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Agreement.</p>
                    <h4>No Rights of Third Parties</h4>
                    <p>None of the terms of this Agreement can be enforced by any persons who are not a party to this Agreement.</p>
                    <h4>Notices and Consent to Receive Notices Electronically</h4>
